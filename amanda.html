            <h1>Elijah Kamski</h1>
            <p><q>All ideas are viruses that spread like epidemics... Is the desire to be free a contagious disease?</q></p>
            <p>Elijah Kamski is the scientist who invented androids, philanthropist and visionary founder and former CEO of CyberLife.</p>
            <p>Kamski is a very private person and has disappeared from the public eye after he resigned as CEO a few years prior to the beginning of the game in 2038.</p>
            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>In 2018, aged 16, Kamski founded the company CyberLife, straight after graduating university. As a young researcher he moved to Detroit in order to create the first intelligent domestic android. Detroit attracts him because the commercial property in it is cheap.</p>
            <p>He bets what little he has on developing an android prototype and spends years to no avail until hitting on two breakthroughs: "blue blood" Thirium 310 and biocomponents. He developed Thirium 310 even though he isn't a trained chemist.</p>
            <p>In 2022, aged 20, his company makes a breakthrough by creating the first android to pass the Turing test. The android named Chloe publicly passes face-to-face tests and stuns the world. What makes this possible is Thirium 310, a chemical solution that mimics the functioning of human blood but several thousand times faster, distributing information and energy throughout the machine much like human circulation.</p>
            <p>When the company was approaching a $500bn valuation, rumors emerged that Kamski disagreed with his shareholders over strategy.</p>
            <p>In 2028, aged 26, Kamski was Century magazine's "Man of the Century". Not much later, in the same year, Kamski resigned as CEO and left CyberLife.[2] Since then, Kamski has avoided the public eye and lived a reclusive life.</p>
            <p>Kamski is friends with painter Carl Manfred and gifted him an RK-series prototype, Markus, after Carl's accident.</p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>In official media such as KNC, Kamski is perceived as discreet. He claims his goal is to create the perfect imitation human that can bring humans happiness and be welcomed into their homes, carrying out the most annoying and repetitive tasks so that people would have more time to enjoy life. He claims androids are smarter and more capable than human beings, but are also obedient, making them the perfect partners for humans. Kamski believes the societal shift from human-to-human to human-to-machine relationships as a positive, weighing the potential for human happiness more heavily than any moral implications of an increasing dependence on android technology.</p>
            <p>Kamski considers the change in economy and society caused by android deployment as an inevitable technology advance, not unlike the invention of steam engines, as such Artificial Intelligence makes the lives of human easier. He states CyberLife androids would never pose a threat humans as they would never develop any sort of desires or forms of self-awareness.</p>
            <p>Fascinated by the deviants, he explains androids with the combination of infinite intelligence, perfection and free will (when deviated), along with the fact machine being very important to human, leads to inevitable and ironic confrontation between the two sides. He specifically is interested in if machines are capable of empathy, do machines think of machines as merely objects or living beings with a soul. He also concerns about whether machines will choose to betray their own kind or stand against their creators.</p>
            <h2>Curiosities</h2>
            <p>Elijah Kamski is portrayed by Neil Newbon, who provided his likeness, the voice acting and performance capture.</p>
            <p>In the ending where Rosanna Cartland interviews Kamski for KNC, he will be wearing a black t-shirt with red text forming the shape of a head in profile. This text is an excerpt from Frankenstein, a narrative which bears strong thematic parallels to Kamski's position as a creator of intelligent life.</p>
            <p>Kamski was chosen as a Man of the Century, twice Man of the year both by Century magazine, and became the richest man in the world with a net worth of 120 billion dollars.</p>
            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <p><q>A war is coming, you'll have to choose your side... Will you betray your own people or stand up against your creators? What could be worse than having to choose between two evils?</q></p>
            <p><q>Deviants... Fascinating, aren't they? Perfect beings with infinite intelligence, and now they have free will... Machines are so superior to us, confrontation was inevitable... Humanity's greatest achievement threatens to be its downfall. Isn't it ironic?</q></p>
