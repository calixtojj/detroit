        <h1>Connor</h1>
        <p><q>I have no side, I was designed to stop deviants and that's what I intend to do.</q></p>
        <p>Connor is an RK800 android and one of the three protagonists in Detroit: Become Human. Built as an advanced prototype, he is designed to assist human law enforcement; specifically in investigating cases involving deviant androids, becoming a successful deviants hunter.</p>
        <p>Sent to the Detroit City Police Department, Connor has been assigned to work with Lt. Hank Anderson. Throughout the course of their investigation, Connor may make discoveries about cases, himself, and become a deciding agent in tipping the coming events.</p>
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Connor is a CyberLife RK-series prototype, model RK800, serial #313 248 317. He was released in August, 2038.</p>
        <p>He is designed by the company to investigate and deal with deviant androids and assist the Detroit City Police Department therein. He is first sent out to do so in the same month he was released.</p>
        <p>Connor starts out with an "- 51" appended to his serial number, which counts up according to bodies used.</p>
        <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <h3>Forensics and Reconstructs</h3>
        <p>Connor has the ability to scan and analyze a scene and recreate events that took place in a reconstruction. This unlocks new dialogue choices and narrative paths.</p>
        <p>His ability to reconstruct a sequence of events is both hyper-advanced and entirely unique to him. To perform a reconstruct, physical and circumstantial details must first be analyzed in isolation, providing vital information such as the direction of travel, velocities, and trajectories, likely collisions based on material density and friction, etc.</p>
        <p>Connor can analyze biological evidence (such as blood samples) in real time by putting them on his tongue to "taste" them. He can identify blood types, DNA (including identifying a specific human), drugs, sample age, and probably more. The same applies to android blood, where he can determine the model and serial number.</p>
        <p>Connor is able to reconstruct events and crimes from the gathered data using a physical simulation software. With it, Connor's cutting-edge processors simulate the most probable version of events leading to the picture of evidence he has just discovered and analyzed, with every element playing a part in his cognitive simulation. Similarly, he can preconstruct events: He can also predict the probability of an imminent event, physical and mental status of other androids, showing as the statistic in his internal interface, which he can refer to decide on his choices.</p>
        <h3>Psychology, Negotiation, Interrogation</h3>
        <p>Connor has a social module to enable him to more easily integrate and adapt to humans and work in a team.</p>
        <p>Connor is designed to analyze the psychology and behaviour of humans, androids, and deviants, to be able to reconstruct, predict, and manipulate their actions. This aids him in his function as a police assistant, and the associated skills as a negotiator and interrogator.</p>
        <p>Connor is trained to act at par with a real-life negotiator; he is one of the first non-human negotiators in service of Detroit city. He can also present facts and tell lies without inducing intense emotion, which is shown by his non-changing LED light.</p>
        <h3>Vocal imitation</h3>
        <p>Connor is able to replicate the voices of others by lip-syncing and mimicking their sound and speech pattern.</p>
        <p>He can use this ability to trick people and androids to collect useful information about deviants.</p>
        <h3>Martial skills</h3>
        <p>Unlike previous police androids who are forbidden from using violence or bearing weapons in accordance with the American Androids Act, Connor is capable of unarmed combat and of handling weapons.</p>
        <p>He is physically athletic and can swiftly traverse difficult terrain, as well as physically fight. He can and does handle firearms from small handguns to a sniper rifle.</p>
        <p>Connor does not carry a weapon as standard equipment. While the legal framework is not known, Connor may use weapons several times during the game for which he seemingly suffers no repercussions. Later, he may even kill humans while on his mission for CyberLife. As Deviant Connor, he is naturally exempt from programmed restrictions and no longer beholden to any prohibitions on using violence or weapons.</p>
        <h3>Reincarnation</h3>
        <p>In case of his death, CyberLife can redeploy a new RK800 Connor model, inserting the previous one's memories into the new body. Connor regularly backs up his memory at CyberLife and can do emergency backups if death is imminent. Some data can be lost in the process.</p>
        <p>After each death, a gravestone is added in the Zen Garden stating his name, mark, serial number, place and time of death. The first Connor is "Mark (I)" with "-51" appended to his serial number, both of which are counted up by one with each death and rebirth.</p>
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Connor is presented as a clean-cut, attractive young man appearing to be in his late twenties to mid thirties. He possesses brown eyes and dark brown hair.</p>
        <p>Connor wears a uniform consisting of a semi-formal grey jacket, white shirt, dark tie, and dark jeans. The jacket carries the usual identifying markers for androids: A blue armband on the right arm, on the front a blue triangle on the left breast and his model and serial numbers on the right breast. The back of his jacket has across the shoulders the word ANDROID, a larger blue triangle, and his model number RK800.</p>
        <p>The wearing of a comparatively human formal attire, instead of the usual android uniform style, remains something of a rarity among fellow androids, reflecting his special function as an investigator with advanced abilities.</p>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>Connor, in the beginning, is indifferent to the treatment of androids in Detroit. When the game first begins he is shown flicking a quarter coin (US currency, 1994 issue) between his hands and fingers while waiting in the elevator, a unique characteristic of his android programming. How he came by this particular coin remains to be seen, but it is explained that Connor flicks his coin to calibrate his physical and cognitive functions, sharpening himself for the challenges ahead.</p>
        <p>At Chicken Feed, Connor explains to Hank that his facial features and voice were designed for harmonious and seamless integration with humans. This explains his unassuming expression and his clear and concise diction.</p>
        <p>Although he may have consciousness, his core programming is to complete the mission, going to lengths of self-sacrifice to complete his mission.</p>
        <p>From the start, Connor is a neutral character. Depending on the player's choices, Connor’s core personality throughout the game can take several directions. For example, utilizing the choices that keep Connor focused on accomplishing his mission will result in his portrayal as a cold, ruthless individual only interested in completing his mission by any means necessary, even if it means betraying or killing his own people or his friends. Conversely, the player could choose to make him a more sympathetic, pacifist character who refuses to kill his own people. Regardless of choices, Connor can be seen trying to adapt to situation, even societal ones.</p>
        <p>Dialogue choices play a big part in showcasing and developing Connor's potential personality. Depending on the options, Connor may come across as sarcastic or literal. He is shown to have difficulty making small talk with others, which potentially results in awkwardness (on their part). In pacifist choices, he seems to have a knack for a sense of humor, can be sensitive, and can even get emotional at times.</p>
        <h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
        <p>Connor is portrayed by Bryan Dechart, who provided his likeness, the voice acting and performance capture.</p>
        <p>Connor's serial number: In the earlier released demo of The Hostage, Connor's serial number was #687 899 150. Connor's serial number in the finished game, #313 248 317-51, was decided on by his actor Bryan Dechart: 313 for the Detroit area code, 248 for his home area code (Novi, Michigan), 317 for his birthday (March 17th), 5 for the number of people in his family, and 1 as it is the first Connor.</p>
        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p><q>My name is Connor. I’m the android sent by CyberLife.</q> Connor's repeated greeting.</p>
        <p><q>My predecessor was unfortunately destroyed, but CyberLife transferred its memory and sent me to replace it. This incident should not affect the investigation.</q> Connor's response if he recently died and got replaced.</p>
        <p><q>I like dogs.</q></p>
        <p><q>I think working with an officer with... personal issues is an added challenge. But adapting to human unpredictability is one of my features.</q> Connor's sincere response to Hank</p>
