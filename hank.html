            <h1>Hank Anderson</h1>
            <p><q>Do all androids ask so many personal questions or is it just you?</q></p>
            <p>Lieutenant Hank Anderson is a human in Detroit: Become Human. He is a grizzled, alcoholic detective in the Detroit City Police Department who works at DPD Central Station and holds a grudge against androids.</p>
            <p>STasked with investigating cases involving deviant androids, he is assigned the RK800 android, Connor, to assist him with deviant android cases.</p>
            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Hank Anderson was born on September 6, 1985. He was born and raised in Detroit.</p>
            <p>Hank graduated top of his class and as Valedictorian of his police academy and joined the Detroit City Police Department. He started out as a beat cop on the streets and eventually became a police detective.</p>
            <p>In 2027 and 2028 Hank was part of the Red Ice Task Force that cracked down on dealers that distributed the drug Red Ice. In 2029, (reported in the news on August 22) he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, making him the youngest lieutenant in Detroit history. He went on to secure a number of high-profile arrests and served as an integral part of the task force, continuing to be a member until at least 2031. At some point, he joined the homicide division.</p>
            <p>Just a month after he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, Hank's son, Cole, was born on September 23, 2029. In 2035, he and Cole were in a car accident, when a truck skidded on a sheet of ice presumably hitting Hank's car and causing it to roll over. Cole needed emergency surgery and was operated on by an android because the human surgeon was unavailable due to being under the influence of Red Ice. Cole did not survive, dying on October 11th of 2035.</p>
            <p>Cole's death led Hank into a spiral of immense grief, depression, alcoholism and suicidal tendencies. Given the circumstances of his son's death, this made him develop a resentment towards androids, blaming them for the death of his son.</p>
            <p>His job performance also suffered in the years since then, stalling his once brilliant career. He has received a notable amount of disciplinary actions from the department and Captain Jeffrey Fowler.</p>
            <p>Hank lives in a house with his dog, Sumo. He spends most of his free time at home or at various bars, such as Jimmy's Bar. He eats out at the Chicken Feed most of the time.</p>

            </figure>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Hank is a tall man with gray jaw-length hair and a full beard. Due to a poor diet and alcoholism, he possesses a small beer belly and a generally disorganized appearance. Hank has blue eyes and a relative retro fashion style. During his youth, Hank possessed short brown hair, as seen in photos and the image that comes up when Connor scans Hank.</p>
            <p>Hank has several outfits:a brown jacket over a shirt and dark pants; a warmer, darker jacket over a shirt and dark pants; three colorful shirts worn exchangeable with the above: "Hippy", "Stripy", or "Streaky"; a dark grey DPD hooded sweatshirt; a grey T-shirt and grey boxers. Hank is far from stylish and is often seen dressing untidily in private areas. </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Hank was once a competent and courageous person, recommended in his field of work and highly regarded by his colleagues, professionally and personally. Since his son's death, he has changed, becoming gruff and ill-tempered with a low opinion of the world and humanity. He is angry about emotionless beings that take orders without regard to lives, both in humans and androids. From time to time he is friends with people who break part of the law, as is the case of Pedro Aabdar and Gary Kayes that he says if they do not hurt anyone he does not have problems with them.</p>
            <p>Hank has gained self-destructive behaviors, suffering from alcoholism and suicidal tendencies. He is quite aware of his condition, stating that he is killing himself a little bit each day as he can not bring himself to outright commit suicide.</p>
            <p>He is not particular about the letter of the law; as long as it hurts no one, Hank lets it be.</p>
            <p>Hank is embarrassed about ordering a prostitute service, even though Connor requested him to rent a Traci for helping to track the blue-haired Traci. He also thinks Connor may have a humanistic desire for companionship, as shown in Connor's insisting on going to Eden Club, Connor being distracted by displayed models</p>
            <p>Hank is disgusted by Connor's repeated tasting of android blood for forensics. Hank also shows in several occasions that he unknowingly wants Connor to act humanely.</p>
            <h2>Curiosities</h2>
            <p>Hank Anderson is portrayed by Clancy Brown, who provided his likeness, the voice acting and performance capture.</p>
            <p>Hank seems to like unhealthy food, coffee, drinking, dark heavy metal music, and Jazz music.</p>
            <p>He drives an 1988 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Brougham.</p>
            <p>After confiscating Connor's quarter coin in the elevator, Hank can be seen trying to perform Connor's coin tricks</p>
            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <p><q>Listen asshole, if it was up to me I'd throw the lot of ya in a dumpster and set a match to it, so stop pissing me off! Or things are gonna get nasty.</q> Hank getting annoyed at Connor.</p>
            <p><q>You’re starting to piss me off with that coin, Connor.</q> When taking Connor’s coin away in the elevator.</p>
            <p><q>Sumo!..Attack!...Good Dog.</q></p>
            <p><q>Err, Jesus! What the hell are you doing?...Ok, just don't put anymore evidence in your mouth, you got it?</q> When seeing Connor sample evidence for the first time.</p>
            <p><q>What about you Connor? You look human, you sound human... but what are you really?</q>Hank to Connor.</p>
            <p><q>You know where you can stick your instructions?</q> When Connor ir being persistent.</p>
