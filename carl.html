            <h1>Carl Manfred</h1>
            <p><q>This world doesn't like those who are different, Markus. Don't let anyone tell you who you should be</q></p>
            <p>Carl Manfred is a celebrated painter and owner of the RK200 android Markus.</p>
            <p>He is a paraplegic and seems to have other unnamed medical conditions, so Markus acts as his nurse and assistant. Carl treats Markus as if he were a son, teaching him to paint, exposing him to literature and music; developing his spirit a little each day.</p>
            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Carl is an artist and painter. He became the leading figurehead of the "Neo-Symbolist movement" in the 2020s. After a years-long proliferate period, Carl fell into a dark period marred by alcohol and drugs (possibly after the accident).</p>
            <p>Carl has a son named Leo, born in 2010 from a short affair with an unnamed fan. Carl acknowledged Leo as his son and paid child support, but never met Leo until he was a teenager. They have a strained relationship, Leo believing Carl never wanted him and thus never loved him. Leo is also addicted to Red Ice and is always in and out of sobriety, which also puts a strain on their relationship.</p>
            <p>At some point Carl was in a severe accident, losing the use of his legs and becoming a paraplegic. For several years afterwards, Carl became reclusive and depressed. His friend Elijah Kamski, founder of CyberLife, gifted him an RK200 prototype android, Markus, as a caretaker and companion for the aged and disabled Carl. Unconditionally devoted to Carl, Markus heeds his advice on studying literature and music, and listens to his philosophies about the world and humanity. Under Markus' care, Carl recovered his motivation for life and painting, and they cultivated a father-son relationship.</p>
            <p>Although Markus resulted in a great improvement in Carl's quality of life and happiness, Carl's relationship with Leo became further strained. Leo was jealous of Markus and his relationship with Carl, believing Carl treated Markus better than him. He brings up more than once that Carl must love Markus more than him because Markus is "perfect".</p>

            </figure>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Carl has grey hair, blue eyes, and several moles which most notably appear on the side of his forehead. He also has tattoos that cover both of his arms; the left has a geometric design while the right arm seems to be more detailed.</p>
            <p>In "The Painter," he is seen to be wearing a black shirt with blue pants. After he finishes his shower, he wears a dark blue cardigan with beige pants and a snake-like patterned scarf.</p>
            <p>After his party at the Museum of Modern Art, he wore a brown coat with a dark red tux jacket and a detailed scarf. He also wears dark denim pants with black shoes.</p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Carl can be sarcastic, often having quick-witted and playful responses for Markus. Despite his good humor, Carl can also be quite somber and reflective, often bringing up his own old age, poor health, and impending death in a matter-of-fact way, once referring to himself as "just an old man clinging to his brushes". He can be a tad misanthropic at times. He expresses having little interest in seeing other people or attending social gatherings, and seems exhausted by said obligations. He also seems to have very little faith in humanity's morality and future.</p>
            <p>Despite his sometimes dour mood, Carl can also be very sentimental and caring. He is one of the first and few human characters in the game to treat androids with respect and kindness, showing concern for Markus when he shows signs of having been assaulted. He is also responsible for encouraging Markus' free thought, telling him to look inside himself and his feelings in order to paint something, which insinuates he believes Markus was already capable of free thought and feeling emotions despite being an android. Carl chose to let Marcus wear human clothes in the house. In many ways Carl is greatly responsible for the android revolution and a great portion of the game's events, having raised Markus to believe in his own autonomy.</p>
            <h2>Curiosities</h2>
            <p>During "The Painter," Markus mentions that Carl's retrospective art is on display at the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
            <p>A painting of Carl's in displayed in Kamski's house next to his pool, and it can also be seen in Carl's house next to his dining table.</p>
            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <p><q>Face the abyss.....but don’t let it consume you.</q></p>
            <p><q>You’re my son, Markus....Our blood isn’t the same color but I know a part of me is in you.</q></p>
            <p><q>That is a perfect copy of reality. But painting is not about replicating the world, it's about interpreting it, improving on it, showing something you see.</q></p>
            <p><q>Being alive is making choices. Between love and hate, between holding out your hand or closing it as a fist....I don’t have any easy answers, Markus. You have to accept the world as it is.....or fight to change it.</q></p>
