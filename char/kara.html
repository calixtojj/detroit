            <h1>Kara</h1>
            <p><q>She needs me. And I need her. It's as simple as that.</q></p>
            <p>Kara is an AX400 android and one of the three protagonists in Detroit: Become Human. She is a common housemaid android serving in the home of her owner Todd Williams and caring for his daughter Alice Williams.</p>
            <p>Kara's connection to her young charge may trigger an upheaval that breaks Kara from her repetitive existence and starts her on a journey out into the world, at a time when androids may rise up and confront their creators.</p>
            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <h3>Kara (2012)</h3> <!-- https://youtu.be/G0KTUysrwgQ -->
            <p>During her assembly, the android "Kara" was tested on her physical and cognitive functions by the Operator. When she realized she was going to be reset, sold, and considered an object, Kara showed distress, noting: "I thought I was alive." The Operator noted that as an error for which she would have to be disassembled and analyzed for. Scared and tearful, Kara begged for her life and mind, moving the Operator to halt disassembly and send her out to sale despite her "error", on the promise that she keep quiet about it.</p>
            <h3>Pre-game</h3>
            <p>Kara, AX400 #579 102 694, was sent to a store where she was quickly sold, and later resold several times.</p>
            <p>Eventually, she was bought by her latest owner, former taxi driver Todd Williams. He assigns her to look after his home and daughter, Alice. Todd was abusive, violent, and broke Kara several times in the past, at least some of which was due to her trying to protect Alice. Each time, Kara was sent for repair and returned fixed with a reset memory.</p>

                <figcaption>Kara Concept Art</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Kara has blue eyes and long brown hair, done up in a low bun at the back. She also has a LED ring on her right temple, to distinguish her as an android and indicate her mental status. Later, to change her appearance and make her less easily identifiable, she removes her LED and cuts her hair into a short pixie style; at the same time, the player can alter her hair's color, choosing between white, blonde, black, or the previous brown.</p>
            <p>Initially, Kara wears a standard android uniform style, with a white and black short-sleeved tunic and white pants and shoes, alluding to the French housemaid dress. After becoming a fugitive, Kara has several outfits of human clothes throughout the rest of the game.</p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Marketed in 2032 by CyberLife, AX400 model androids are designed to take care of the housework and look after young children. They can speak 300 different languages, cook more than 9000 dishes, tell 9000 children stories, help children with their homework and play with them. They are highly popular because of their ability to get along with little kids. As a model primarily used to take care of family, especially children, she is designed to act kind, patient, obedient and all around pleasant.</p>
            <p>However, in "KARA", it can be seen that Kara has the capacity to feel emotions, much to the surprise of her operator. She is almost disassembled after she expresses independent thought but is later kept alive after she tells her operator that she feels fear. </p>
            <p>As a deviant, Kara is primarily motivated by a desire for parenting. Her sole and primary purpose even after becoming deviant is to protect Alice and make her happy again, no matter the cost. She may be extremely loyal to Alice and may lose the will to live if Alice dies. She is capable of being gentle, caring and compassionate.</p>
            <p>Kara initially distrusts Luther but accepts his aid in taking them to someone who knows how to cross the Canadian border. Over time she may befriend or be distant to Luther; as Luther becomes a father figure to Alice, Alice's reaction to Kara has an impact on Luther's view on her. In several paths she may become selfless and entrust Alice to Luther should she choose to sacrifice herself.</p>
            <p>Initially naive and nervous, she may perform reckless actions including robbing, stealing, and breaking property. This behavior could be changed for better or worse, as she may subsequently perform ruthless deeds including selling out comrades for survival, or noble actions such as saving other humans and androids.</p>
            <p>Kara is small, not very strong and inexperienced in combat, and when it comes to fighting bigger and stronger opponents she tends to encounter, she has to make use of her wit to come out in one piece, and relies on the environment around her and creativity to win a fight. She rarely has scenes where she is actually fighting someone. Almost all of her quick-time events are her escaping with Alice.</p>
            <h2>Curiosities</h2>
            <p>Kara is portrayed by Valorie Curry, who provided her likeness, the voice acting and performance capture. Curry was first cast in 2010 for the titular role in the short film "KARA", and reprise her role for the game.</p>
            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <p><q>That's enough! Leave her alone! (...) No... I want you to leave Alice alone!</q> Kara to Todd as she is protecting Alice.</p>
            <p><q>Im sure we were friends before I was reset!</q> When Kara first met Alice after reset.</p>
            <p><q>Please.. We just want to be free.</q> Kara asking for help</p>
