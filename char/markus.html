            <p>Carl is a celebrated painter, but after the accident, he becomes a recluse and stops painting. Markus helps Carl with all everyday tasks but mostly provides companionship. Over time, his presence helps Carl gradually regain a taste for life. At first, he sees Markus as a sophisticated yet stupid machine, but as the relationship between him and the android develops, Carl's mind changes. In time, they become like father and son. However, this relationship causes Carl's biological son Leo to feel anger toward Markus and his father.</p>

            </figure>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Markus has green eyes, tan skin and very short black hair. After "From the Dead" his right eye has been exchanged for a blue eye.</p>
            <p>Elijah Kamski wanted to design an unique android for Carl to offer him company that pleases his aesthetic values and could support him in any way he wanted it to. </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Markus' interactions with Carl leads him to express himself better and live more freely compared to other androids. He likes to play music and chess. Since he lives in a bubble-like place with Carl, he does not know how harsh the outside world is.</p>
            <p>Eventually, Carl develops Markus' soul and as the story progresses, Markus takes it upon himself to free other androids from bondage by breaking their programming.</p>
            <p>Depending on the player's actions, Markus' personality can greatly change. Markus could end up being a selfish, ruthless, wrathful maniac towards humans, or he can be a compassionate, kind, and pacifist leader who seeks peace between humans and androids.</p>
            <h2>Curiosities</h2>
            <p>Markus is portrayed by Jesse Williams, who provided his likeness, the voice acting and performance capture.</p>
