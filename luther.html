            <h1>Luther</h1>
            <p><q>You shouldn't have done that. You can't put Alice in danger. Go now, before they come back!</q></p>
            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Luther is an TR400 model android, designed as a strong laborer. Luther doesn't remember much about his time before coming to his current owner Zlatko Andronikov.</p>
            <p>Like other androids that were unlucky enough to find themselves in Zlatko's workshop, Luther was modified to serve as a personal assistant, security and 'muscle' for Zlatko's operation, obeying and serving him ruthlessly.</p>
            <h2>Appearence</h2>
            <p>Luther is a black android with brown eyes and short curly black hair. Luther is one of the biggest and strongest androids in the story, towering over every android and human he meets and is capable of fantastic physical feats that far outdo the average strength of an android.</p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Before becoming deviant, Luther is obedient, although he shows remorse when Alice is taken away from Kara. However, he can become very mentally unstable when witnessing a child protecting his or her parent. After becoming deviant, Luther remains quiet but shows care and understanding to both Kara and Alice. He accepts his mistakes, tries to focus on the future whenever possible, and tries to encourage the duo. He would also sacrifice himself to ensure the survival of the latter and he states he is willing to do so. Alternatively he will take the job of protecting Alice should Kara choose to sacrifice herself. He vastly takes advice from Kara, to a degree of rarely objecting her.</p>
            <p>Although Luther is less seen in parenting, he puts effort into being a gentle father to Alice, and encourages Kara into accepting the true nature of Alice, telling her that does not deter what the duo desires. Luther shows exceptional care for Alice, calling her as the most special person that he has met in the world.</p>
            <h2>Curiosities</h2>
            <p>Luther is portrayed by Evan Parke, who provided his likeness, the voice acting and performance capture.</p>
            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <p><q>Forgetting who we are, to become what someone needs us to be, maybe that's what love is about.</q></p>
            <p><q>You two are okay... That's all that matters... You're gonna have to continue the journey without me... You're the most extraordinary person I've ever met, Alice... I was a machine... You made me part of a family. Take good care of Kara...You promise me?</q></p>
            <p><q>Don't forget me, Alice...</q></p>

            <h1>Zlatko Andronikov</h1>
            <p><q>I warned you! Dreams always end in tears... You should've listened to me...</q></p>
            <p>Zlatko Andronikov is a human in Detroit: Become Human, appearing as an antagonist.</p>
            <p>He trades in androids, selling them for profit, and experimenting on them. To acquire new material he also lures deviant androids to him under the pretense of giving them aid.</p>
            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>He is the descendant of an aristocratic Russian family that fled their home country at the time of the 1917 revolution. At his generation, the family fortune was severely depleted and he led a troubled and degenerate life. His legacy was quickly squandered and his family's glorious past was a past to him.</p>
            <p>He was in jail for a few years, for embezzlement and fraud.</p>
            <p>Zlatko traded in androids, acquiring his raw material by purchasing cheap secondhand androids and tech, as well as by luring deviants to his home with the promise of helping them; when in actuality he reset and resold them. Zlatko also kept some androids to use in experiments; he had a passion for tinkering with androids and reshaping them into monstrous forms.</p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>He seems to be extremely cold and calculating. He also shows obsessiveness and hostility on whoever gets in his way.</p>
            <p>Zlakto is a collector, who likes to harm androids only for his morbid curiosity and sadistic pleasure.</p>
            <h2>Curiosities</h2>
            <p>Zlatko is implied to be a Red Ice user, as evidenced by the pipe (similar to the one used by Todd) that can be seen on one of the dressers in his house.</p>
            <p>A substance that appears to be Blue Blood can be seen on Zlatko's hands during the initial encounter with him and the girls. This could be seen as a foreshadowing of his true intentions.</p>
            <p>It's possible that Zlatko has androids working on his behalf to lure deviants to his mansion, as evidenced by the WR600 who tells Kara it's a place where she and Alice can get help.</p>
            <p>Zlatko is portrayed by Saul Jephcott.</p>
            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <p><q>Get away from me! Get away from me! Obey me! I'm your master! I'M YOUR MASTER!</q></p>
            <p><q>Ohhhh pooooor little Alice! Aw look like mommy doesn't remember you at all, huh? Looks like mommy's completely forgotten you! Alright that's enough, come on, You bit me, I'm gonna teach you some manners, you little bitch...</q></p>
