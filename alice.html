            <h1>Alice Williams</h1>
            <p><q>All I wanted was a life like other girls. Maybe I did something wrong? Maybe I wasn't good enough? That's why he was always so angry.</q></p>
            <p>Alice Williams is a main character in Detroit: Become Human. Living with her father Todd Williams and dealing with his violent mood swings, Alice is cared for by the android named Kara. Events may bring both of them together in a deep bond and lead them on a quest for freedom and safety.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>From the beginning, Alice seems to be a really quiet, meek and sullen little girl that can be seen playing with her toy Timothy, which she has a great attachment to, visibly affected by Todd's abuse. She also seems to be fairly sensitive towards Todd and others. It is revealed Alice has a fear to Todd for breaking Kara, and feels overwhelmingly sad whenever Kara is seemingly killed, leading to traumas regarding broken home. She copes with her sadness by reading.</p>

            <h1>Todd Williams</h1>
            <p><q>You stay there! Don't you dare fucking move, or I'll bust you worse than last time.</q></p>
            <p>Todd Williams is a human in Detroit: Become Human. He is the father of Alice Williams and the owner of Kara, who he assigns to look after his home and daughter. </p>
            <p>Kamski is a very private person and has disappeared from the public eye after he resigned as CEO a few years prior to the beginning of the game in 2038.</p>
            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Todd was a former taxi driver who lost his job when self-driving cars became popular in 2021. He then became a laborer, then a bouncer and security guard, only for androids to replace human labor in each of these fields too. For several years he had been working odd jobs, including dealing Red Ice, a powerful stimulant, as part of a small drug trade around the neighborhood to pay for his own addiction. He was arrested several times for drug trafficking and also for violent misdemeanors.</p>
            <p>Todd had a wife. Unhappy with his behavior and addictions, his wife left. Todd claims she entered into a relationship with an accountant.</p>
            <p>Dwelling on his memories and his hatred for androids, who he blames for his sad predicament, Todd is abusive towards both Alice and Kara. He destroyed Kara multiple times before the start of the game, who was repaired and sent back reset with a memory wipe.</p>
            <h2>Appearence</h2>
            <p>Todd is a white middle-aged man who has brown hair that reaches to his neck with blue eyes, a stocky build</p>
            <p>In The Opening, Todd is seen to be wearing a dark olive jacket. The regular out is a maroon top with a dark green cardigan over it, dark denim jeans with black shoes.</p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>He seems to be extremely hot-headed and resorts to violence when it is "needed" (due to his wife leaving and his addiction to Red Ice) and says to Kara that he will "bust her worse than last time" if she moves. As a Red Ice addict, he is prone to frequently inhale Red Ice for comfort. He also shows obsessiveness and hostility on whoever gets in his way.</p>
            <p>Todd is highly emotionally unstable and tends to have extreme flashes of rage over the smallest perceived slights. He loses control frequently, contributing to multiple destructions of Kara before the story begins. Todd tends to believe that he can tell what other people are thinking just by looking at them. He shows signs of having a persecution complex and believes that his misfortunes in life are caused by people intentionally screwing him over. For example, he believes that his wife left him for an accountant without a word, when in fact she had told Todd at least once before their divorce that his anger was scary and that he needs to stop abusing drugs. Todd constantly deflects blame to others for his own mistakes and shameful feelings.</p>
            <p>Todd's extreme mood swings can result in him going from mercilessly beating his daughter in a blind-rage, to then sobbing on her shoulder and repeating to himself that loves her just seconds later.</p>
            <p>Todd is possibly combating depression and has been taking an antidepressant called Zolpidem Tartrate (seen on the bottle label), the warnings on this medicine read "Contains Tianeptine" and "Risk of behavioral disorders".</p>
            <h2>Curiosities</h2>
            <p>Todd is one of three confirmed named Red Ice users, the others being Carlos Ortiz and Leo Manfred.</p>
            <p>Todd also uses sleeping pills.</p>
            <p>Todd is going through financial troubles based on bills lying in his room. He has failed to pay utilities and owing money to Harman Bank.</p>
            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <p><q>Alice, Honey... Alice... Look... Look, Daddy's wounded. Be a good little girl... Come... Come... Come help, Daddy...</q>Todd to Alice after being wounded while fighting Kara.</p>
            <p><q>What are you looking at...? (.) What's your fuckin' problem? (..) Not the life you dreamed of eh? (..) Maybe you think this is easy? (..) Maybe you think, It's my fault we live in this fuckin' shithole! My fault you fuckin' mother took off! (.) You should stop takin' drugs, Todd. Sometimes you really scare me, Todd. Fuckin' bitch took off without a word. Fuckin' whore walked out on me for a fuckin' accountant! It's all your fault! (..) It's all your fucking fault!</q>Todd ranting about his ex-wife to Alice.</p>
            <p><q>This is your fault. This is all your fault. None of this woulda happened if it weren't for you. THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!</q></p>
